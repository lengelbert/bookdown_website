[["index.html", "A Comparison of Carnivore Monitoring Techniques Chapter 1 Project Description", " A Comparison of Carnivore Monitoring Techniques Lindsey Engelbert 2023-03-19 Chapter 1 Project Description This chapter of my dissertation will compare the precision, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of four wildlife monitoring techniques - GPS collars, remote camera traps, hair snares, and scat detection dogs - at “capturing” and estimating density for sympatric large mammalian carnivores in Utah, specifically black bears, bobcats,and cougars. This will involve comparing the number of raw detections (i.e., the proportion of cells where a species was detected by a single survey method) and the number of unique detections (i.e., the number of times a detection by a given method represented the only detection of that species). I will compare these metrics across methods and species. It will also involve calculating the per survey cost of each method. Lastly, I will run various population models with the data to estimate the abundance and/or density of each species and compare the precision of each population estimation model and its source data.
