# Project Description

This chapter of my dissertation will compare the precision, efficiency, and 
cost-effectiveness of four wildlife monitoring techniques - GPS collars, 
remote camera traps, hair snares, and scat detection dogs - at "capturing" and 
estimating density for sympatric large mammalian carnivores in Utah, 
specifically black bears, bobcats,and cougars. This will involve comparing the 
number of raw detections (i.e., the proportion of cells where a species was 
detected by a single survey method) and the number of unique detections (i.e., 
the number of times a detection by a given method represented the only 
detection of that species). I will compare these metrics across methods and 
species. It will also involve calculating the per survey cost of each method. 
Lastly, I will run various population models with the data to estimate the 
abundance and/or density of each species and compare the precision of each 
population estimation model and its source data.
